Food waste accounts for a significant portion of waste generated in Singapore, and
the amount of food waste generated has increased by roughly 20% over the last
decade (Towards Zero Waste, n.d.). Singapore generated 817,000 tonnes of food
waste in 2021 alone (National Environment Agency, 2022). Countries with
comparable population sizes like Denmark have already made significant strides in
curbing food wastage, with food wastage levels reducing by up to 25% in the past
five years (Lemos, 2017). In contrast, Singapore’s progress towards food waste
reduction has remained stagnant.

Current government efforts in reducing food waste are mostly geared towards
households - through publicity campaigns on food wastage awareness (National
Environment Agency, 2016). While there exists food redistribution organisations for
both households and food retail establishments alike to donate surplus food,
incentives to do so remain low.

In order for food waste reduction efforts to be sustainable and significant, current
efforts must be supplemented with movements that mutually benefit both
merchants and the everyday Singaporean. This is because food waste reduction
is a joint effort, and focusing purely on one individual party would be unlikely to yield
any significant changes.

Currently, there is no platform on the market that allows merchants to directly
offload their excess perishable food with the everyday Singaporean. Surplus
food donation schemes often have to go through middlemen (like charitable
organisations) and even then, merchants still incur the same losses in food costs.
For Singapore to make major advances toward reducing food wastage, we need to
create an avenue that directly benefits both parties.

We want to create a web application that enables Merchants such as restaurants
and supermarkets to offer surplus food that they would otherwise dispose of at the
end of the day, for sale. As a first step, we hope that merchants are able to put up
all of their perishable food items onto the platform, and that 80% of it will be
purchased by avid customers keen on affordable food options. The benefits of
our web application are as described:

1. Merchants can easily create and manage product listings to offer
surplus perishable food to avid customers.
Other merchant-specific benefits include:
- Robust analytics dashboard for merchants to derive business
insights and understand sales patterns - allowing them to interpret
purchase trends with the end goal of gradually reducing their food
wastage. The dashboard includes valuable metrics like lifetime
revenue and top listings by revenue, as well as concise graphs that
plot revenue over time. These metrics and graphs would be
imperative in making informed business decisions in the future -
such as deciding how much food to order to mitigate food wastage
related expenditure.

2. Customers looking for affordable meal options can browse an attractive
marketplace that displays the aforementioned product listings with all the
related details, then make an order and collect the food from the
merchant’s food establishment.
Other customer-specific benefits include:
- Seamless integration with Stripe - customers can make payment
safely and conveniently using payment APIs powered by Stripe

3. Both customers and merchants have access to a convenient internal chat
functionality to streamline the order and collection process, allowing
customers to dispel confusion on pickup location and merchants to improve
customer relations.

4. As there is a direct benefit to using the application for both customers and
merchants, food wastage reduction in Singapore will see tangible progress.
